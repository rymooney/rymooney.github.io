title: "Text Analysis"
format: html

Today, I will be practicing my text analysis using str\_\*() commands, regular expressions, and plotting character-based data! To do this, I will be analyzing character data from all of Emily Dickinson's Poems!

Some of the packages I will need:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse) 
```

The original data is from [Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12242/12242-h/12242-h.htm) and has been compiled by [Amherst Statistics](https://github.com/Amherst-Statistics/DickinsonPoems).

*Accessing the data, printing some of the contents, and reading a poem!*

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
devtools::install_github("Amherst-Statistics/DickinsonPoems")

head(list.files(system.file("extdata", package = "DickinsonPoems"))) # first six files in the repo

poem166 <- paste(system.file("extdata", package = "DickinsonPoems"), 
                  "gutenberg3.txt166", sep = "/")
readLines(poem166)
```
