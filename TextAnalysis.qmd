title: "Text Analysis"

Today, I will be practicing my text analysis using str\_\*() commands, regular expressions, and plotting character-based data! To do this, I will be analyzing character data from all of Emily Dickinson's Poems!

Some of the packages I will need:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse) 
```

The original data is from [Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12242/12242-h/12242-h.htm) and has been compiled

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
devtools::install_github("Amherst-Statistics/DickinsonPoems")
```

These are the first six files contained in the DickinsonPoems repo, each containing one poem:

```{r}
list.files(system.file("extdata", package = "DickinsonPoems"))[1:6]
```

For example, here is one of the poems:

```{r}
poem166 <- paste(system.file("extdata", package = "DickinsonPoems"), 
                  "gutenberg3.txt166", sep = "/")
readLines(poem166)
```
