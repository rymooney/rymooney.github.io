Hi and welcome to my site!

# My background

I am originally from Denver, Colorado. I have three older sisters, who are some of my biggest inspirations. After graduating high school in 2023, I went to Pomona College, where I expect to graduate in 2027 with a Bachelor of Arts in Molecular Biology and a minor in Data Science. 

# My research experience
At Pomona College, I have been involved in research since my freshman year. In Dr. Malkiat Johal's lab, I work to quantify biomolecular interactions. I have worked on various projects leveraging surface chemistry instruments like Quartz Crystal Microgravimetry with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). My work over my first-year was on the QCM-D, where we quantified off-target effects of beta-cyclodextrin drugs on biomimetic lipid membranes, which was published in Langmuir. I then switched gears over the summer and worked with the SPR to develop a novel method using chemical kinetics data to determine the molecular weight of polyelectrolytes (this work has been submitted, and we are waiting to hear back from the reviewers!). I am working on developing and finalizing some other projects related to enzyme inhibition and immuno-oncological interactions, so stay tuned for updates!
