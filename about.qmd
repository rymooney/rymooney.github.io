Hi and welcome to my site!

# My background

I am originally from Denver, Colorado. I have three older sisters, who are some of my biggest inspirations. After graduating high school in 2023, I started at [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/), where I expect to graduate in 2027 with a Bachelor of Arts in [Molecular Biology](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/molecular-biology).

# Interested in my research?

At Pomona, I research biomolecular interactions in Dr. Malkiat Johal’s lab using QCM-D and LSPR, contributing to many projects and pushing my work to publication.

I also trained in immuno-oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering, where I helped engineer and evaluate neoantigen-specific TCR-T cells using cell culture, ELISA, IncuCyte imaging, and flow cytometry, including testing IL-18 armoring and CD8 co-receptor expression—now moving toward *in vivo* studies.

For more specific information on my research experience, please see my [Research Projects](https://rymooney.github.io/ResearchProjects) page.

# Want to know what I'm up to?

Outside of the lab and my academics, I enjoy learning data science skills (see my website section "Data Science" for examples!), reading books, crafting, and learning languages. I have spent time working a variety of positions at Pomona College. Specifically, I have served as a course mentor for Organic Chemistry I and II, Genomics and Transcriptomics, Cell Biology, General Chemistry, and Genetics.
