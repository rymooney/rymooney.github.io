    "text": "The Task\nToday, I will be practicing my text analysis using str_*() commands, regular expressions, and plotting character-based data! To do this, I will be analyzing character data from all of The New York Times’ headlines from years 1996-2006.\n\n\nThe Data\nThe data is sample dataset containing headlines from The New York Times, compiled by Professor Amber E. Boydstun at the University of California, Davis. The dataset can be accessed in the RTextTools library on R from the RTextTools package. The data is in the library in a data frame called NYTimes.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(RTextTools) \ndata(NYTimes)\nas_tibble(NYTimes)\n\n# A tibble: 3,104 × 5\n   Article_ID Date      Title                                 Subject Topic.Code\n        &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;                                 &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n 1      41246 1-Jan-96  Nation's Smaller Jails Struggle To C… Jails …         12\n 2      41257 2-Jan-96  FEDERAL IMPASSE SADDLING STATES WITH… Federa…         20\n 3      41268 3-Jan-96  Long, Costly Prelude Does Little To … Conten…         20\n 4      41279 4-Jan-96  Top Leader of the Bosnian Serbs Now … Bosnia…         19\n 5      41290 5-Jan-96  BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW… Battle…          1\n 6      41302 7-Jan-96  South African Democracy Stumbles on … politi…         19\n 7      41314 8-Jan-96  Among Economists, Little Fear on Def… econom…          1\n 8      41333 10-Jan-96 BATTLE OVER THE BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW… budget…          1\n 9      41344 11-Jan-96 High Court Is Cool To Census Change   census…         20\n10      41355 12-Jan-96 TURMOIL AT BARNEYS: THE DIFFICULTIES… barney…         15\n# ℹ 3,094 more rows\n\n\nThe libraries I will need:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\n\nLet’s analyze!\nLet’s see what years the dataset has.\n\nNYTimes_dates &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  mutate(date_as_dmy = dmy(Date)) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    earliestdate = min(date_as_dmy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    latestdate   = max(date_as_dmy, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nNYTimes_dates\n\n  earliestdate latestdate\n1   1996-01-01 2006-12-31\n\n\nFirst, I am interested in the most common word that appears in The New York Times’ headlines. I will look for words that are 3 characters or longer to avoid single letters and short words like “a” or “an”.\n\nword_counts &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  mutate(Title_lower = str_to_lower(Title))|&gt;\n  mutate(words = str_extract_all(Title_lower, \"\\\\b[a-z]{3,}\\\\b\")) |&gt;\n  unnest(words) |&gt;\n  count(words, sort = TRUE)\n\nword_counts\n\n# A tibble: 5,906 × 2\n   words        n\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 the        866\n 2 for        420\n 3 and        312\n 4 new        205\n 5 bush       129\n 6 with       113\n 7 iraq       108\n 8 war         85\n 9 overview    80\n10 nation      72\n# ℹ 5,896 more rows\n\n\nSo, excluding common, non-interesting words, we can see that “bush” is the most talked about noun in the headlines from the years 1996-2006. Let’s see the distribution of this over the years. I also want to exclude the mention of bush fires, which also took place and were talked about on NYT often, so I will reflect that in my regular expression using a negative look-forward!\n\nbush_mentioned &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  mutate(Title_lower = str_to_lower(Title))|&gt;\n  mutate(date = dmy(Date))|&gt;\n  mutate(year = year(date))|&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(Title_lower, \"\\\\bbush\\\\b(?!\\\\s*fires)\")) |&gt;\n  count(year)\n\nbush_mentioned\n\n  year  n\n1 1999  2\n2 2000 15\n3 2001 32\n4 2002 20\n5 2003 16\n6 2004 20\n7 2005 13\n8 2006  8\n\nggplot(bush_mentioned, aes(x = year, y = n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Presence of 'Bush' in NYT Headlines yearly (1996–2006)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"summed count per year\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a peak in the mentions of “Bush” in the year 2001. This makes sense due to his inauguration as President of the United States and the September 11th both taking place that year.\nOn the topic of presidents, let’s quantify how much different presidents were talked about in the New York Times across the time frame represented by this data. I will use another regular expression to find the words “Bush”, “Clinton”, and “Obama”, excluding the search for “bush fire”, mentions of “Hillary Clinton”, and “Michelle Obama”, as for this analysis I am only looking for information on the presidents. To do this, I will make use of a couple of lookarounds, which are proving to be quite useful for specifying data!\n\npresident_names &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    titles_lower = str_to_lower(Title),\n    president = str_extract(\n      titles_lower,\n      \"(?&lt;!laura\\\\s)\\\\bbush(?!\\\\s*fires?)\\\\b|(?&lt;!hillary\\\\s)\\\\bclinton\\\\b|\n      (?&lt;!michelle\\\\s)\\\\bobama\\\\b\")) |&gt;\n  select(titles_lower, president) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(president))|&gt;\n  group_by(president)|&gt;\n  summarize(count=n())\n\n\npresident_names |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = president, y = count)) +\n  geom_col()+\n  labs(\n    title = 'Mentions of \"Bush\" and \"Clinton\" in NYT Headlines (1996–2006)',\n    x = \"President\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Bush was mentioned more than Clinton in this dataset from the years 1996 to 2006. Both were mentioned more than Obama, with 0 mentions.This makes sense as Obama only started running for election in 2007, right after this dataset ends. However, it is a bit surprising that he wasn’t mentioned at all prior to the year before his election. Curious!\nFinally, I am interested to see how the timing of the mentions of each of these presidents compares and if I can pull out historical dates from the peaks in the following plot.\n\npresidents_mentioned &lt;- NYTimes |&gt;\n  mutate(Title_lower = str_to_lower(Title)) |&gt;\n  mutate(date = dmy(Date)) |&gt;\n  mutate(year = year(date)) |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(Title_lower, \"\\\\b(bush(?!\\\\s*fires?)|clinton)\\\\b\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    president = ifelse(\n      str_detect(Title_lower, \"\\\\bbush(?!\\\\s*fires?)\\\\b\"),\n      \"Bush\", \"Clinton\")) |&gt;\n  group_by(year, president) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(presidents_mentioned, aes(x = year, y = n, color = president)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1996, 2006, by = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Presence of 'Bush' and 'Clinton' in NYT Headlines\",\n    subtitle= \"1996-2006\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Summed count per year\",\n    color = \"President\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the mentions of “Clinton” peak in 1998, when he was impeached. Mentions of “Bush” begin rising shortly after, with this pattern starting to get mentioned in 1999, when his campaign for presidential election was occuring and leading to his victory in 2000. Bush was inaugurated in 2001 and that year is also when the September 11th attacks took place, so mentions of Bush were extremely high that year. There is another peak in 2004 in “Bush” mentions again, given his re-election as president.\nWe can use text data to see how much different topics are being talked about in the media, which is a very important thing to know, and it can be useful to identify specific periods of interest.\nAnd… that’s it for today!"

    "text": "Hi and welcome to my site!\n\nMy background\nI am originally from Denver, Colorado. I have three older sisters, who are some of my biggest inspirations. After graduating high school in 2023, I went to Pomona College, where I expect to graduate in 2027 with a Bachelor of Arts in Molecular Biology and a minor in Data Science.\n\n\nMy research experience\nAt Pomona College, I have been involved in research since my freshman year. In Dr. Malkiat Johal’s lab, I work to quantify biomolecular interactions. I have worked on various projects leveraging surface chemistry instruments like Quartz Crystal Microgravimetry with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). My work over my first-year was on the QCM-D, where we quantified off-target effects of beta-cyclodextrin drugs on biomimetic lipid membranes, which was published in Langmuir. I then switched gears over the summer and worked with the SPR to develop a novel method using chemical kinetics data to determine the molecular weight of polyelectrolytes (this work has been submitted, and we are waiting to hear back from the reviewers!). I am working on developing and finalizing some other projects related to enzyme inhibition and immuno-oncological interactions, so stay tuned for updates!\nI have also been fortunate enough to engage in research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center under the guidance of Dr. Michael Gormally and Dr. Christopher Klebanoff. Here, I gained training in immuno-oncology and contributed to a project with the goals of designing immunotherapies for solid-phase cancers. Specificaly, this project involved working with cell culture, ELISA, IncuCyte live-cell imaging, and flow cytometry to evaluate and quantify the killing of cancer cells by T cells transduced with cancer neoepitope-specific T cell receptors. I got to experiment with armoring our T cells with additional potency, in the form of constitutive cytoking (IL-18) secretion and by engineering CD8 co-receptor expression. Our results were tremendously promising, and in vivo trials of our work are beginning now!"
