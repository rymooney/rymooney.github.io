    "text": "Hi and welcome to my site!\n\nMy background\nI am originally from Denver, Colorado. I have three older sisters, who are some of my biggest inspirations. After graduating high school in 2023, I went to Pomona College, where I expect to graduate in 2027 with a Bachelor of Arts in Molecular Biology and a minor in Data Science.\n\n\nMy research experience at Pomona\nAt Pomona College, I have been involved in research since my freshman year. In Dr. Malkiat Johal’s lab, I work to quantify biomolecular interactions. I have worked on various projects leveraging surface chemistry instruments like Quartz Crystal Microgravimetry with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). My work over my first-year was on the QCM-D, where we quantified off-target effects of beta-cyclodextrin drugs on biomimetic lipid membranes, which was published in Langmuir. I then switched gears over the summer and worked with the SPR to develop a novel method using chemical kinetics data to determine the molecular weight of polyelectrolytes (this work has been submitted, and we are waiting to hear back from the reviewers!). I am working on developing and finalizing some other projects related to enzyme inhibition and immuno-oncological interactions, so stay tuned for updates!\n\n\nMy research experience outside of Pomona"

    "text": "Hi there! I am Ryan, a student at Pomona College majoring in Molecular Biology and minoring in Data Science. I am an aspiring biomedical researcher, with keen interests in cancer biology and immuno-oncology. Sequencing has revolutionized how we analyze genetic information, so minoring in data science has provided me with invaluable skills to approach translational research questions. I love learning, and pursuing a career in research is how I plan to continue doing what I love (to learn!). I am a rather crafty person, and I particularly enjoy knitting, sewing, and collaging.\nCheck out the pages on my site to learn more about me!"
