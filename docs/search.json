    "text": "Hi there! I am Ryan, a student at Pomona College majoring in Molecular Biology and minoring in Data Science. I am an aspiring biomedical researcher, with keen interests in cancer biology and immuno-oncology. Sequencing has revolutionized how we analyze genetic information, so minoring in data science has provided me with invaluable skills to approach translational research questions. I love learning, and pursuing a career in research is how I plan to continue doing what I love (to learn!). I am a rather crafty person, and I particularly enjoy knitting, sewing, and collaging.\nCheck out the pages on my site to learn more about me!"
