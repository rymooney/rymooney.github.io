I am an aspiring biomedical researcher, with keen interests in cancer biology and immuno-oncology. Sequencing has revolutionized how we analyze genetic information, so minoring in data science has provided me with invaluable skills to approach translational research questions. I love learning, and pursuing a career in research is how I plan to continue doing what I love (to learn!). I am a rather crafty person, and I particularly enjoy knitting, sewing, and collaging.\nCheck out the pages on my site to learn more about me!"

    "text": "Hi and welcome to my site!\n\nMy background\nI am originally from Denver, Colorado. I have three older sisters, who are some of my biggest inspirations. After graduating high school in 2023, I went to Pomona College, where I expect to graduate in 2027 with a Bachelor of Arts in Molecular Biology and a minor in Data Science.\n\n\nMy research experience\nAt Pomona College, I have been involved in research since my freshman year. In Dr. Malkiat Johal’s lab, I work to quantify biomolecular interactions. I have worked on various projects leveraging surface chemistry instruments like Quartz Crystal Microgravimetry with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). My work over my first-year was on the QCM-D, where we quantified off-target effects of beta-cyclodextrin drugs on biomimetic lipid membranes, which was published in Langmuir. I then switched gears over the summer and worked with the SPR to develop a novel method using chemical kinetics data to determine the molecular weight of polyelectrolytes (this work has been submitted, and we are waiting to hear back from the reviewers!). I am working on developing and finalizing some other projects related to enzyme inhibition and immuno-oncological interactions, so stay tuned for updates!\nI have also been fortunate enough to engage in research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center under the guidance of Dr. Michael Gormally and Dr. Christopher Klebanoff. Here, I gained training in immuno-oncology and contributed to a project with the goals of designing immunotherapies for solid-phase cancers. Specificaly, this project involved working with cell culture, ELISA, IncuCyte live-cell imaging, and flow cytometry to evaluate and quantify the killing of cancer cells by T cells transduced with cancer neoepitope-specific T cell receptors. I got to experiment with armoring our T cells with additional potency, in the form of constitutive cytoking (IL-18) secretion and by engineering CD8 co-receptor expression. Our results were tremendously promising, and in vivo trials of our work are beginning now!"
