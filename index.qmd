Hi there! I am Ryan, a student at [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/) majoring in [Molecular Biology](https://www.pomona.edu/academics/departments/molecular-biology). I am an aspiring biomedical researcher, with keen interests in cancer biology and immuno-oncology. I have worked to get [research experience](https://rymooney.github.io/ResearchProjects) in these areas, and I hope to eventually pursue a Ph.D. in immunology. Spending time developing skills in data science has provided me with invaluable skills to approach translational research questions. I love learning, and pursuing a career in research is how I plan to continue doing what I love (to learn!). I am a rather crafty person, and I particularly enjoy knitting, sewing, and collaging.

Please feel free to check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w1SbAwWlfGOGqOSWWsFMGZmgbWWrx7zE/view?usp=sharing).
